too she was naturally so peculiar in appearance as not to show
disfigurement like any other woman  she needed both advantages for
the marks of gripping fingers were deep in her face and her hair was
torn and her dress hastily composed with unsteady hands was
clutched and dragged a hundred ways

in crossing the bridge she dropped the door key in the river
arriving at the cathedral some few minutes before her escort and
waiting there she thought what if the key were already taken in a
net what if it were identified what if the door were opened and the
remains discovered what if she were stopped at the gate sent to
prison and charged with murder  in the midst of these fluttering
thoughts the escort appeared took her in and took her away

is there any noise in the streets she asked him

the usual noises mr cruncher replied and looked surprised by the
question and by her aspect

i dont hear you said miss pross  what do you say

it was in vain for mr cruncher to repeat what he said miss pross
could not hear him  so ill nod my head thought mr cruncher
amazed at all events shell see that  and she did

is there any noise in the streets now asked miss pross again
presently

again mr cruncher nodded his head

i dont hear it

gone deaf in an hour said mr cruncher ruminating with his mind
much disturbed wots come to her

i feel said miss pross as if there had been a flash and a crash
and that crash was the last thing i should ever hear in this life

blest if she aint in a queer condition said mr cruncher more
and more disturbed  wot can she have been a takin to keep her
courage up  hark  theres the roll of them dreadful carts  you can
hear that miss

i can hear said miss pross seeing that he spoke to her
nothing  o my good man there was first a great crash and then a
great stillness and that stillness seems to be fixed and
unchangeable never to be broken any more as long as my life lasts

if she dont hear the roll of those dreadful carts now very nigh
their journeys end said mr cruncher glancing over his shoulder
its my opinion that indeed she never will hear anything else in
this world

and indeed she never did

the footsteps die out for ever


along the paris streets the deathcarts rumble hollow and harsh
six tumbrils carry the days wine to la guillotine  all the
devouring and insatiate monsters imagined since imagination could
record itself are fused in the one realisation guillotine  and yet
there is not in france with its rich variety of soil and climate
a blade a leaf a root a sprig a peppercorn which will grow to
maturity under conditions more certain than those that have produced
this horror  crush humanity out of shape once more under similar
hammers and it will twist itself into the same tortured forms
sow the same seed of rapacious license and oppression over again
and it will surely yield the same fruit according to its kind

six tumbrils roll along the streets  change these back again to what
they were thou powerful enchanter time and they shall be seen to
be the carriages of absolute monarchs the equipages of feudal nobles
the toilettes of flaring jezebels the churches that are not my
fathers house but dens of thieves the huts of millions of starving
peasants  no the great magician who majestically works out the
appointed order of the creator never reverses his transformations
if thou be changed into this shape by the will of god say the
seers to the enchanted in the wise arabian stories then remain so
but if thou wear this form through mere passing conjuration then resume
thy former aspect  changeless and hopeless the tumbrils roll along

as the sombre wheels of the six carts go round they seem to plough
up a long crooked furrow among the populace in the streets  ridges
of faces are thrown to this side and to that and the ploughs go
steadily onward  so used are the regular inhabitants of the houses
to the spectacle that in many windows there are no people
and in some the occupation of the hands is not so much as suspended
while the eyes survey the faces in the tumbrils  here and there
the inmate has visitors to see the sight then he points his finger
with something of the complacency of a curator or authorised exponent
to this cart and to this and seems to tell who sat here yesterday
and who there the day before

of the riders in the tumbrils some observe these things and all
things on their last roadside with an impassive stare others with
a lingering interest in the ways of life and men  some seated with
drooping heads are sunk in silent despair again there are some so
heedful of their looks that they cast upon the multitude such glances
as they have seen in theatres and in pictures  several close their
eyes and think or try to get their straying thoughts together
only one and he a miserable creature of a crazed aspect is so
shattered and made drunk by horror that he sings and tries to
dance  not one of the whole number appeals by look or gesture to
the pity of the people

there is a guard of sundry horsemen riding abreast of the tumbrils
and faces are often turned up to some of them and they are asked
some question  it would seem to be always the same question for
it is always followed by a press of people towards the third cart
the horsemen abreast of that cart frequently point out one man in it
with their swords  the leading curiosity is to know which is he
he stands at the back of the tumbril with his head bent down
to converse with a mere girl who sits on the side of the cart
and holds his hand  he has no curiosity or care for the scene about him
and always speaks to the girl  here and there in the long street
of st honore cries are raised against him  if they move him at all
it is only to a quiet smile as he shakes his hair a little more
loosely about his face  he cannot easily touch his face his arms
being bound

on the steps of a church awaiting the comingup of the tumbrils
stands the spy and prisonsheep  he looks into the first of them
not there  he looks into the second  not there  he already asks
himself has he sacrificed me when his face clears as he looks
into the third

which is evremonde says a man behind him

that  at the back there

with his hand in the girls

yes

the man cries down evremonde  to the guillotine all aristocrats
down evremonde

hush hush the spy entreats him timidly

and why not citizen

he is going to pay the forfeit  it will be paid in five minutes more
let him be at peace

but the man continuing to exclaim down evremonde the face of
evremonde is for a moment turned towards him  evremonde then sees
the spy and looks attentively at him and goes his way

the clocks are on the stroke of three and the furrow ploughed among
the populace is turning round to come on into the place of execution
and end  the ridges thrown to this side and to that now crumble in
and close behind the last plough as it passes on for all are following
to the guillotine  in front of it seated in chairs as in a garden
of public diversion are a number of women busily knitting  on one
of the foremost chairs stands the vengeance looking about for her
friend

therese she cries in her shrill tones  who has seen her
therese defarge

she never missed before says a knittingwoman of the sisterhood

no nor will she miss now cries the vengeance petulantly
therese

louder the woman recommends

ay  louder vengeance much louder and still she will scarcely hear
thee  louder yet vengeance with a little oath or so added and yet
it will hardly bring her  send other women up and down to seek her
lingering somewhere and yet although the messengers have done dread
deeds it is questionable whether of their own wills they will go far
enough to find her

bad fortune cries the vengeance stamping her foot in the chair
and here are the tumbrils  and evremonde will be despatched in a
wink and she not here  see her knitting in my hand and her empty
chair ready for her  i cry with vexation and disappointment

as the vengeance descends from her elevation to do it the tumbrils
begin to discharge their loads  the ministers of sainte guillotine
are robed and ready  crasha head is held up and the knitting
women who scarcely lifted their eyes to look at it a moment ago when
it could think and speak count one

the second tumbril empties and moves on the third comes up  crash
and the knittingwomen never faltering or pausing in their work
count two

the supposed evremonde descends and the seamstress is lifted out
next after him  he has not relinquished her patient hand in getting
out but still holds it as he promised  he gently places her with
her back to the crashing engine that constantly whirrs up and falls
and she looks into his face and thanks him

but for you dear stranger i should not be so composed for i am
naturally a poor little thing faint of heart nor should i have been
able to raise my thoughts to him who was put to death that we might
have hope and comfort here today  i think you were sent to me by heaven

or you to me says sydney carton  keep your eyes upon me dear child
and mind no other object

i mind nothing while i hold your hand  i shall mind nothing when
i let it go if they are rapid

they will be rapid  fear not

the two stand in the fastthinning throng of victims but they speak
as if they were alone  eye to eye voice to voice hand to hand
heart to heart these two children of the universal mother else so
wide apart and differing have come together on the dark highway
to repair home together and to rest in her bosom

brave and generous friend will you let me ask you one last
question  i am very ignorant and it troubles mejust a little

tell me what it is

i have a cousin an only relative and an orphan like myself whom i
love very dearly  she is five years younger than i and she lives in
a farmers house in the south country  poverty parted us and she
knows nothing of my fatefor i cannot writeand if i could how
should i tell her  it is better as it is

yes yes  better as it is

what i have been thinking as we came along and what i am still
thinking now as i look into your kind strong face which gives me so
much support is thisif the republic really does good to the poor
and they come to be less hungry and in all ways to suffer less she
may live a long time  she may even live to be old

what then my gentle sister

do you think the uncomplaining eyes in which there is so much
endurance fill with tears and the lips part a little more and
tremble  that it will seem long to me while i wait for her in the
better land where i trust both you and i will be mercifully sheltered

it cannot be my child there is no time there and no trouble
there

you comfort me so much  i am so ignorant  am i to kiss you now
is the moment come

yes

she kisses his lips he kisses hers they solemnly bless each other
the spare hand does not tremble as he releases it nothing worse than
a sweet bright constancy is in the patient face  she goes next
before himis gone the knittingwomen count twentytwo

i am the resurrection and the life saith the lord
he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live
and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die

the murmuring of many voices the upturning of many faces
the pressing on of many footsteps in the outskirts of the crowd
so that it swells forward in a mass like one great heave of water
all flashes away  twentythree

                      

they said of him about the city that night that it was the
peacefullest mans face ever beheld there  many added that he looked
sublime and prophetic

one of the most remarkable sufferers by the same axea womanhad
asked at the foot of the same scaffold not long before to be
allowed to write down the thoughts that were inspiring her  if he
had given any utterance to his and they were prophetic they would
have been these

i see barsad and cly defarge the vengeance the juryman the
judge long ranks of the new oppressors who have risen on the
destruction of the old perishing by this retributive instrument
before it shall cease out of its present use  i see a beautiful city
and a brilliant people rising from this abyss and in their struggles
to be truly free in their triumphs and defeats through long years
to come i see the evil of this time and of the previous time of
which this is the natural birth gradually making expiation for
itself and wearing out

i see the lives for which i lay down my life peaceful useful
prosperous and happy in that england which i shall see no more
i see her with a child upon her bosom who bears my name  i see her
father aged and bent but otherwise restored and faithful to all
men in his healing office and at peace  i see the good old man so
long their friend in ten years time enriching them with all he has
and passing tranquilly to his reward

i see that i hold a sanctuary in their hearts and in the hearts of
their descendants generations hence  i see her an old woman
weeping for me on the anniversary of this day  i see her and her
husband their course done lying side by side in their last earthly
bed and i know that each was not more honoured and held sacred in
the others soul than i was in the souls of both

i see that child who lay upon her bosom and who bore my name a man
winning his way up in that path of life which once was mine  i see
him winning it so well that my name is made illustrious there by the
light of his  i see the blots i threw upon it faded away  i see
him foremost of just judges and honoured men bringing a boy of my
name with a forehead that i know and golden hair to this place
then fair to look upon with not a trace of this days disfigurement
and i hear him tell the child my story with a tender and a faltering
voice
too she was naturally so peculiar in appearance as not to show
disfigurement like any other woman  she needed both advantages for
the marks of gripping fingers were deep in her face and her hair was
torn and her dress hastily composed with unsteady hands was
clutched and dragged a hundred ways

but the man continuing to exclaim down evremonde the face of
evremonde is for a moment turned towards him  evremonde then sees
the spy and looks attentively at him and goes his way

the clocks are on the stroke of three and the furrow ploughed among
the populace is turning round to come on into the place of execution
and end  the ridges thrown to this side and to that now crumble in
and close behind the last plough as it passes on for all are following
to the guillotine  in front of it seated in chairs as in a garden
of public diversion are a number of women busily knitting  on one
of the foremost chairs stands the vengeance looking about for her
friend

therese she cries in her shrill tones  who has seen her
therese defarge

she never missed before says a knittingwoman of the sisterhood

no nor will she miss now cries the vengeance petulantly
therese

louder the woman recommends

ay  louder vengeance much louder and still she will scarcely hear
thee  louder yet vengeance with a little oath or so added and yet
it will hardly bring her  send other women up and down to seek her
lingering somewhere and yet although the messengers have done dread
deeds it is questionable whether of their own wills they will go far
enough to find her

bad fortune cries the vengeance stamping her foot in the chair
and here are the tumbrils  and evremonde will be despatched in a
wink and she not here  see her knitting in my hand and her empty
chair ready for her  i cry with vexation and disappointment

as the vengeance descends from her elevation to do it the tumbrils
begin to discharge their loads  the ministers of sainte guillotine
are robed and ready  crasha head is held up and the knitting
women who scarcely lifted their eyes to look at it a moment ago when
it could think and speak count one

the second tumbril empties and moves on the third comes up  crash
and the knittingwomen never faltering or pausing in their work
count two

the supposed evremonde descends and the seamstress is lifted out
next after him  he has not relinquished her patient hand in getting
out but still holds it as he promised  he gently places her with
her back to the crashing engine that constantly whirrs up and falls
and she looks into his face and thanks him

but for you dear stranger i should not be so composed for i am
naturally a poor little thing faint of heart nor should i have been
able to raise my thoughts to him who was put to death that we might
have hope and comfort here today  i think you were sent to me by heaven

or you to me says sydney carton  keep your eyes upon me dear child
and mind no other object

i mind nothing while i hold your hand  i shall mind nothing when
i let it go if they are rapid

they will be rapid  fear not

the two stand in the fastthinning throng of victims but they speak
as if they were alone  eye to eye voice to voice hand to hand
heart to heart these two children of the universal mother else so
wide apart and differing have come together on the dark highway
to repair home together and to rest in her bosom

brave and generous friend will you let me ask you one last
question  i am very ignorant and it troubles mejust a little

tell me what it is

i have a cousin an only relative and an orphan like myself whom i
love very dearly  she is five years younger than i and she lives in
a farmers house in the south country  poverty parted us and she
knows nothing of my fatefor i cannot writeand if i could how
should i tell her  it is better as it is

yes yes  better as it is

what i have been thinking as we came along and what i am still
thinking now as i look into your kind strong face which gives me so
much support is thisif the republic really does good to the poor
and they come to be less hungry and in all ways to suffer less she
may live a long time  she may even live to be old

what then my gentle sister

do you think the uncomplaining eyes in which there is so much
endurance fill with tears and the lips part a little more and
tremble  that it will seem long to me while i wait for her in the
better land where i trust both you and i will be mercifully sheltered

it cannot be my child there is no time there and no trouble
there

you comfort me so much  i am so ignorant  am i to kiss you now
is the moment come

yes

she kisses his lips he kisses hers they solemnly bless each other
the spare hand does not tremble as he releases it nothing worse than
a sweet bright constancy is in the patient face  she goes next
before himis gone the knittingwomen count twentytwo

i am the resurrection and the life saith the lord
he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live
and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die

the murmuring of many voices the upturning of many faces
the pressing on of many footsteps in the outskirts of the crowd
so that it swells forward in a mass like one great heave of water
all flashes away  twentythree

                      

they said of him about the city that night that it was the
peacefullest mans face ever beheld there  many added that he looked
sublime and prophetic

one of the most remarkable sufferers by the same axea womanhad
asked at the foot of the same scaffold not long before to be
allowed to write down the thoughts that were inspiring her  if he
had given any utterance to his and they were prophetic they would
have been these

i see barsad and cly defarge the vengeance the juryman the
judge long ranks of the new oppressors who have risen on the
destruction of the old perishing by this retributive instrument
before it shall cease out of its present use  i see a beautiful city
and a brilliant people rising from this abyss and in their struggles
to be truly free in their triumphs and defeats through long years
to come i see the evil of this time and of the previous time of
which this is the natural birth gradually making expiation for
itself and wearing out

i see the lives for which i lay down my life peaceful useful
prosperous and happy in that england which i shall see no more
i see her with a child upon her bosom who bears my name  i see her
father aged and bent but otherwise restored and faithful to all
men in his healing office and at peace  i see the good old man so
long their friend in ten years time enriching them with all he has
and passing tranquilly to his reward

i see that i hold a sanctuary in their hearts and in the hearts of
their descendants generations hence  i see her an old woman
weeping for me on the anniversary of this day  i see her and her
husband their course done lying side by side in their last earthly
bed and i know that each was not more honoured and held sacred in
the others soul than i was in the souls of both

i see that child who lay upon her bosom and who bore my name a man
winning his way up in that path of life which once was mine  i see
him winning it so well that my name is made illustrious there by the
light of his  i see the blots i threw upon it faded away  i see
him foremost of just judges and honoured men bringing a boy of my
name with a forehead that i know and golden hair to this place
then fair to look upon with not a trace of this days disfigurement
and i hear him tell the child my story with a tender and a faltering
voice
too she was naturally so peculiar in appearance as not to show
disfigurement like any other woman  she needed both advantages for
the marks of gripping fingers were deep in her face and her hair was
torn and her dress hastily composed with unsteady hands was
clutched and dragged a hundred ways

in crossing the bridge she dropped the door key in the river
arriving at the cathedral some few minutes before her escort and
waiting there she thought what if the key were already taken in a
net what if it were identified what if the door were opened and the
remains discovered what if she were stopped at the gate sent to
prison and charged with murder  in the midst of these fluttering
thoughts the escort appeared took her in and took her away

is there any noise in the streets she asked him

the usual noises mr cruncher replied and looked surprised by the
question and by her aspect

i dont hear you said miss pross  what do you say

it was in vain for mr cruncher to repeat what he said miss pross
could not hear him  so ill nod my head thought mr cruncher
amazed at all events shell see that  and she did

is there any noise in the streets now asked miss pross again
presently

again mr cruncher nodded his head

i dont hear it

gone deaf in an hour said mr cruncher ruminating with his mind
much disturbed wots come to her

i feel said miss pross as if there had been a flash and a crash
and that crash was the last thing i should ever hear in this life

blest if she aint in a queer condition said mr cruncher more
and more disturbed  wot can she have been a takin to keep her
courage up  hark  theres the roll of them dreadful carts  you can
hear that miss

i can hear said miss pross seeing that he spoke to her
nothing  o my good man there was first a great crash and then a
great stillness and that stillness seems to be fixed and
unchangeable never to be broken any more as long as my life lasts

if she dont hear the roll of those dreadful carts now very nigh
their journeys end said mr cruncher glancing over his shoulder
its my opinion that indeed she never will hear anything else in
this world

and indeed she never did

the footsteps die out for ever


along the paris streets the deathcarts rumble hollow and harsh
six tumbrils carry the days wine to la guillotine  all the
devouring and insatiate monsters imagined since imagination could
record itself are fused in the one realisation guillotine  and yet
there is not in france with its rich variety of soil and climate
a blade a leaf a root a sprig a peppercorn which will grow to
maturity under conditions more certain than those that have produced
this horror  crush humanity out of shape once more under similar
hammers and it will twist itself into the same tortured forms
sow the same seed of rapacious license and oppression over again
and it will surely yield the same fruit according to its kind

six tumbrils roll along the streets  change these back again to what
they were thou powerful enchanter time and they shall be seen to
be the carriages of absolute monarchs the equipages of feudal nobles
the toilettes of flaring jezebels the churches that are not my
fathers house but dens of thieves the huts of millions of starving
peasants  no the great magician who majestically works out the
appointed order of the creator never reverses his transformations
if thou be changed into this shape by the will of god say the
seers to the enchanted in the wise arabian stories then remain so
but if thou wear this form through mere passing conjuration then resume
thy former aspect  changeless and hopeless the tumbrils roll along

as the sombre wheels of the six carts go round they seem to plough
up a long crooked furrow among the populace in the streets  ridges
of faces are thrown to this side and to that and the ploughs go
steadily onward  so used are the regular inhabitants of the houses
to the spectacle that in many windows there are no people
and in some the occupation of the hands is not so much as suspended
while the eyes survey the faces in the tumbrils  here and there
the inmate has visitors to see the sight then he points his finger
with something of the complacency of a curator or authorised exponent
to this cart and to this and seems to tell who sat here yesterday
and who there the day before

of the riders in the tumbrils some observe these things and all
things on their last roadside with an impassive stare others with
a lingering interest in the ways of life and men  some seated with
drooping heads are sunk in silent despair again there are some so
heedful of their looks that they cast upon the multitude such glances
as they have seen in theatres and in pictures  several close their
eyes and think or try to get their straying thoughts together
only one and he a miserable creature of a crazed aspect is so
shattered and made drunk by horror that he sings and tries to
dance  not one of the whole number appeals by look or gesture to
the pity of the people

there is a guard of sundry horsemen riding abreast of the tumbrils
and faces are often turned up to some of them and they are asked
some question  it would seem to be always the same question for
it is always followed by a press of people towards the third cart
the horsemen abreast of that cart frequently point out one man in it
with their swords  the leading curiosity is to know which is he
he stands at the back of the tumbril with his head bent down
to converse with a mere girl who sits on the side of the cart
and holds his hand  he has no curiosity or care for the scene about him
and always speaks to the girl  here and there in the long street
of st honore cries are raised against him  if they move him at all
it is only to a quiet smile as he shakes his hair a little more
loosely about his face  he cannot easily touch his face his arms
being bound

on the steps of a church awaiting the comingup of the tumbrils
stands the spy and prisonsheep  he looks into the first of them
not there  he looks into the second  not there  he already asks
himself has he sacrificed me when his face clears as he looks
into the third

which is evremonde says a man behind him

that  at the back there

with his hand in the girls

yes

the man cries down evremonde  to the guillotine all aristocrats
down evremonde

hush hush the spy entreats him timidly

and why not citizen

he is going to pay the forfeit  it will be paid in five minutes more
let him be at peace

but the man continuing to exclaim down evremonde the face of

father aged and bent but otherwise restored and faithful to all
men in his healing office and at peace  i see the good old man so
long their friend in ten years time enriching them with all he has
and passing tranquilly to his reward

i see that i hold a sanctuary in their hearts and in the hearts of
their descendants generations hence  i see her an old woman
weeping for me on the anniversary of this day  i see her and her
husband their course done lying side by side in their last earthly
bed and i know that each was not more honoured and held sacred in
the others soul than i was in the souls of both

i see that child who lay upon her bosom and who bore my name a man
winning his way up in that path of life which once was mine  i see
him winning it so well that my name is made illustrious there by the
light of his  i see the blots i threw upon it faded away  i see
him foremost of just judges and honoured men bringing a boy of my
name with a forehead that i know and golden hair to this place
then fair to look upon with not a trace of this days disfigurement
and i hear him tell the child my story with a tender and a faltering
voice
too she was naturally so peculiar in appearance as not to show
disfigurement like any other woman  she needed both advantages for
the marks of gripping fingers were deep in her face and her hair was
torn and her dress hastily composed with unsteady hands was
clutched and dragged a hundred ways

in crossing the bridge she dropped the door key in the river
arriving at the cathedral some few minutes before her escort and
waiting there she thought what if the key were already taken in a
net what if it were identified what if the door were opened and the
remains discovered what if she were stopped at the gate sent to
prison and charged with murder  in the midst of these fluttering
thoughts the escort appeared took her in and took her away

is there any noise in the streets she asked him

the usual noises mr cruncher replied and looked surprised by the
question and by her aspect

i dont hear you said miss pross  what do you say

it was in vain for mr cruncher to repeat what he said miss pross
could not hear him  so ill nod my head thought mr cruncher
amazed at all events shell see that  and she did

is there any noise in the streets now asked miss pross again
presently

again mr cruncher nodded his head

i dont hear it

gone deaf in an hour said mr cruncher ruminating with his mind
much disturbed wots come to her

i feel said miss pross as if there had been a flash and a crash
and that crash was the last thing i should ever hear in this life

blest if she aint in a queer condition said mr cruncher more
and more disturbed  wot can she have been a takin to keep her
courage up  hark  theres the roll of them dreadful carts  you can
hear that miss

i can hear said miss pross seeing that he spoke to her
nothing  o my good man there was first a great crash and then a
great stillness and that stillness seems to be fixed and
unchangeable never to be broken any more as long as my life lasts

if she dont hear the roll of those dreadful carts now very nigh
their journeys end said mr cruncher glancing over his shoulder
its my opinion that indeed she never will hear anything else in
this world

and indeed she never did

the footsteps die out for ever


along the paris streets the deathcarts rumble hollow and harsh
six tumbrils carry the days wine to la guillotine  all the
devouring and insatiate monsters imagined since imagination could
record itself are fused in the one realisation guillotine  and yet
there is not in france with its rich variety of soil and climate
a blade a leaf a root a sprig a peppercorn which will grow to
maturity under conditions more certain than those that have produced
this horror  crush humanity out of shape once more under similar
hammers and it will twist itself into the same tortured forms
sow the same seed of rapacious license and oppression over again
and it will surely yield the same fruit according to its kind

six tumbrils roll along the streets  change these back again to what
they were thou powerful enchanter time and they shall be seen to
be the carriages of absolute monarchs the equipages of feudal nobles
the toilettes of flaring jezebels the churches that are not my
fathers house but dens of thieves the huts of millions of starving
peasants  no the great magician who majestically works out the
appointed order of the creator never reverses his transformations
if thou be changed into this shape by the will of god say the
seers to the enchanted in the wise arabian stories then remain so
but if thou wear this form through mere passing conjuration then resume
thy former aspect  changeless and hopeless the tumbrils roll along

as the sombre wheels of the six carts go round they seem to plough
up a long crooked furrow among the populace in the streets  ridges
of faces are thrown to this side and to that and the ploughs go
steadily onward  so used are the regular inhabitants of the houses
to the spectacle that in many windows there are no people
and in some the occupation of the hands is not so much as suspended
while the eyes survey the faces in the tumbrils  here and there
the inmate has visitors to see the sight then he points his finger
with something of the complacency of a curator or authorised exponent
to this cart and to this and seems to tell who sat here yesterday
and who there the day before

of the riders in the tumbrils some observe these things and all
things on their last roadside with an impassive stare others with
a lingering interest in the ways of life and men  some seated with
drooping heads are sunk in silent despair again there are some so
heedful of their looks that they cast upon the multitude such glances
as they have seen in theatres and in pictures  several close their
eyes and think or try to get their straying thoughts together
only one and he a miserable creature of a crazed aspect is so
shattered and made drunk by horror that he sings and tries to
dance  not one of the whole number appeals by look or gesture to
the pity of the people

there is a guard of sundry horsemen riding abreast of the tumbrils
and faces are often turned up to some of them and they are asked
some question  it would seem to be always the same question for
it is always followed by a press of people towards the third cart
the horsemen abreast of that cart frequently point out one man in it
with their swords  the leading curiosity is to know which is he
he stands at the back of the tumbril with his head bent down
to converse with a mere girl who sits on the side of the cart
and holds his hand  he has no curiosity or care for the scene about him
and always speaks to the girl  here and there in the long street
of st honore cries are raised against him  if they move him at all
it is only to a quiet smile as he shakes his hair a little more
loosely about his face  he cannot easily touch his face his arms
being bound

on the steps of a church awaiting the comingup of the tumbrils
stands the spy and prisonsheep  he looks into the first of them
not there  he looks into the second  not there  he already asks
himself has he sacrificed me when his face clears as he looks
into the third

which is evremonde says a man behind him

that  at the back there

with his hand in the girls

yes

the man cries down evremonde  to the guillotine all aristocrats
down evremonde

hush hush the spy entreats him timidly

and why not citizen

he is going to pay the forfeit  it will be paid in five minutes more
let him be at peace

but the man continuing to exclaim down evremonde the face of
evremonde is for a moment turned towards him  evremonde then sees
the spy and looks attentively at him and goes his way

the clocks are on the stroke of three and the furrow ploughed among
the populace is turning round to come on into the place of execution
and end  the ridges thrown to this side and to that now crumble in
and close behind the last plough as it passes on for all are following
to the guillotine  in front of it seated in chairs as in a garden
of public diversion are a number of women busily knitting  on one
of the foremost chairs stands the vengeance looking about for her
friend

therese she cries in her shrill tones  who has seen her
therese defarge

she never missed before says a knittingwoman of the sisterhood

no nor will she miss now cries the vengeance petulantly
therese

louder the woman recommends

ay  louder vengeance much louder and still she will scarcely hear
thee  louder yet vengeance with a little oath or so added and yet
it will hardly bring her  send other women up and down to seek her
lingering somewhere and yet although the messengers have done dread
deeds it is questionable whether of their own wills they will go far
enough to find her

bad fortune cries the vengeance stamping her foot in the chair
and here are the tumbrils  and evremonde will be despatched in a
wink and she not here  see her knitting in my hand and her empty
chair ready for her  i cry with vexation and disappointment

as the vengeance descends from her elevation to do it the tumbrils
begin to discharge their loads  the ministers of sainte guillotine
are robed and ready  crasha head is held up and the knitting
women who scarcely lifted their eyes to look at it a moment ago when
it could think and speak count one

the second tumbril empties and moves on the third comes up  crash
and the knittingwomen never faltering or pausing in their work
count two

the supposed evremonde descends and the seamstress is lifted out
next after him  he has not relinquished her patient hand in getting
out but still holds it as he promised  he gently places her with
her back to the crashing engine that constantly whirrs up and falls
and she looks into his face and thanks him

but for you dear stranger i should not be so composed for i am
naturally a poor little thing faint of heart nor should i have been
able to raise my thoughts to him who was put to death that we might
have hope and comfort here today  i think you were sent to me by heaven

or you to me says sydney carton  keep your eyes upon me dear child
and mind no other object

i mind nothing while i hold your hand  i shall mind nothing when
i let it go if they are rapid

they will be rapid  fear not

the two stand in the fastthinning throng of victims but they speak
as if they were alone  eye to eye voice to voice hand to hand
heart to heart these two children of the universal mother else so
wide apart and differing have come together on the dark highway
to repair home together and to rest in her bosom

brave and generous friend will you let me ask you one last
question  i am very ignorant and it troubles mejust a little

tell me what it is

i have a cousin an only relative and an orphan like myself whom i
love very dearly  she is five years younger than i and she lives in
a farmers house in the south country  poverty parted us and she
knows nothing of my fatefor i cannot writeand if i could how
should i tell her  it is better as it is

yes yes  better as it is

what i have been thinking as we came along and what i am still
thinking now as i look into your kind strong face which gives me so
much support is thisif the republic really does good to the poor
and they come to be less hungry and in all ways to suffer less she
may live a long time  she may even live to be old

what then my gentle sister

do you think the uncomplaining eyes in which there is so much
endurance fill with tears and the lips part a little more and
tremble  that it will seem long to me while i wait for her in the
better land where i trust both you and i will be mercifully sheltered

it cannot be my child there is no time there and no trouble
there

you comfort me so much  i am so ignorant  am i to kiss you now
is the moment come

yes

she kisses his lips he kisses hers they solemnly bless each other
the spare hand does not tremble as he releases it nothing worse than
a sweet bright constancy is in the patient face  she goes next
before himis gone the knittingwomen count twentytwo

i am the resurrection and the life saith the lord
he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live
and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die

the murmuring of many voices the upturning of many faces
the pressing on of many footsteps in the outskirts of the crowd
so that it swells forward in a mass like one great heave of water
all flashes away  twentythree

                      

they said of him about the city that night that it was the
peacefullest mans face ever beheld there  many added that he looked
sublime and prophetic

one of the most remarkable sufferers by the same axea womanhad
asked at the foot of the same scaffold not long before to be
allowed to write down the thoughts that were inspiring her  if he
had given any utterance to his and they were prophetic they would
have been these

i see barsad and cly defarge the vengeance the juryman the
judge long ranks of the new oppressors who have risen on the
destruction of the old perishing by this retributive instrument
before it shall cease out of its present use  i see a beautiful city
and a brilliant people rising from this abyss and in their struggles
to be truly free in their triumphs and defeats through long years
to come i see the evil of this time and of the previous time of
which this is the natural birth gradually making expiation for
itself and wearing out

i see the lives for which i lay down my life peaceful useful
prosperous and happy in that england which i shall see no more
i see her with a child upon her bosom who bears my name  i see her
father aged and bent but otherwise restored and faithful to all
men in his healing office and at peace  i see the good old man so

it is always followed by a press of people towards the third cart
the horsemen abreast of that cart frequently point out one man in it
with their swords  the leading curiosity is to know which is he
he stands at the back of the tumbril with his head bent down
to converse with a mere girl who sits on the side of the cart
and holds his hand  he has no curiosity or care for the scene about him
and always speaks to the girl  here and there in the long street
of st honore cries are raised against him  if they move him at all
it is only to a quiet smile as he shakes his hair a little more
loosely about his face  he cannot easily touch his face his arms
being bound

on the steps of a church awaiting the comingup of the tumbrils
stands the spy and prisonsheep  he looks into the first of them
not there  he looks into the second  not there  he already asks
himself has he sacrificed me when his face clears as he looks
into the third

which is evremonde says a man behind him

that  at the back there

with his hand in the girls

yes

the man cries down evremonde  to the guillotine all aristocrats
down evremonde

hush hush the spy entreats him timidly

and why not citizen

he is going to pay the forfeit  it will be paid in five minutes more
let him be at peace

but the man continuing to exclaim down evremonde the face of
evremonde is for a moment turned towards him  evremonde then sees
the spy and looks attentively at him and goes his way

the clocks are on the stroke of three and the furrow ploughed among
the populace is turning round to come on into the place of execution
and end  the ridges thrown to this side and to that now crumble in
and close behind the last plough as it passes on for all are following
to the guillotine  in front of it seated in chairs as in a garden
of public diversion are a number of women busily knitting  on one
of the foremost chairs stands the vengeance looking about for her
friend

therese she cries in her shrill tones  who has seen her
therese defarge

she never missed before says a knittingwoman of the sisterhood

no nor will she miss now cries the vengeance petulantly
therese

louder the woman recommends

ay  louder vengeance much louder and still she will scarcely hear
thee  louder yet vengeance with a little oath or so added and yet
it will hardly bring her  send other women up and down to seek her
lingering somewhere and yet although the messengers have done dread
deeds it is questionable whether of their own wills they will go far
enough to find her

bad fortune cries the vengeance stamping her foot in the chair
and here are the tumbrils  and evremonde will be despatched in a
wink and she not here  see her knitting in my hand and her empty
chair ready for her  i cry with vexation and disappointment

as the vengeance descends from her elevation to do it the tumbrils
begin to discharge their loads  the ministers of sainte guillotine
are robed and ready  crasha head is held up and the knitting
women who scarcely lifted their eyes to look at it a moment ago when
it could think and speak count one

the second tumbril empties and moves on the third comes up  crash
and the knittingwomen never faltering or pausing in their work
count two

the supposed evremonde descends and the seamstress is lifted out
next after him  he has not relinquished her patient hand in getting
out but still holds it as he promised  he gently places her with
her back to the crashing engine that constantly whirrs up and falls
and she looks into his face and thanks him

but for you dear stranger i should not be so composed for i am
naturally a poor little thing faint of heart nor should i have been
able to raise my thoughts to him who was put to death that we might
have hope and comfort here today  i think you were sent to me by heaven

or you to me says sydney carton  keep your eyes upon me dear child
and mind no other object

i mind nothing while i hold your hand  i shall mind nothing when
i let it go if they are rapid

they will be rapid  fear not

the two stand in the fastthinning throng of victims but they speak
as if they were alone  eye to eye voice to voice hand to hand
heart to heart these two children of the universal mother else so
wide apart and differing have come together on the dark highway
to repair home together and to rest in her bosom

brave and generous friend will you let me ask you one last
question  i am very ignorant and it troubles mejust a little

tell me what it is

i have a cousin an only relative and an orphan like myself whom i
love very dearly  she is five years younger than i and she lives in
a farmers house in the south country  poverty parted us and she
knows nothing of my fatefor i cannot writeand if i could how
should i tell her  it is better as it is

yes yes  better as it is

what i have been thinking as we came along and what i am still
thinking now as i look into your kind strong face which gives me so
much support is thisif the republic really does good to the poor
and they come to be less hungry and in all ways to suffer less she
may live a long time  she may even live to be old

what then my gentle sister

do you think the uncomplaining eyes in which there is so much
endurance fill with tears and the lips part a little more and
tremble  that it will seem long to me while i wait for her in the
better land where i trust both you and i will be mercifully sheltered

it cannot be my child there is no time there and no trouble
there

you comfort me so much  i am so ignorant  am i to kiss you now
is the moment come

yes

she kisses his lips he kisses hers they solemnly bless each other
the spare hand does not tremble as he releases it nothing worse than
a sweet bright constancy is in the patient face  she goes next
before himis gone the knittingwomen count twentytwo

i am the resurrection and the life saith the lord
he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live
and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die

the murmuring of many voices the upturning of many faces
the pressing on of many footsteps in the outskirts of the crowd
so that it swells forward in a mass like one great heave of water
all flashes away  twentythree

                      

they said of him about the city that night that it was the
peacefullest mans face ever beheld there  many added that he looked
sublime and prophetic

one of the most remarkable sufferers by the same axea womanhad
asked at the foot of the same scaffold not long before to be
allowed to write down the thoughts that were inspiring her  if he
had given any utterance to his and they were prophetic they would
have been these

i see barsad and cly defarge the vengeance the juryman the
judge long ranks of the new oppressors who have risen on the
destruction of the old perishing by this retributive instrument
before it shall cease out of its present use  i see a beautiful city
and a brilliant people rising from this abyss and in their struggles
to be truly free in their triumphs and defeats through long years
to come i see the evil of this time and of the previous time of
which this is the natural birth gradually making expiation for
itself and wearing out

i see the lives for which i lay down my life peaceful useful
prosperous and happy in that england which i shall see no more
i see her with a child upon her bosom who bears my name  i see her
father aged and bent but otherwise restored and faithful to all
men in his healing office and at peace  i see the good old man so
long their friend in ten years time enriching them with all he has
and passing tranquilly to his reward

i see that i hold a sanctuary in their hearts and in the hearts of
their descendants generations hence  i see her an old woman
weeping for me on the anniversary of this day  i see her and her
husband their course done lying side by side in their last earthly
bed and i know that each was not more honoured and held sacred in
the others soul than i was in the souls of both

i see that child who lay upon her bosom and who bore my name a man
winning his way up in that path of life which once was mine  i see
him winning it so well that my name is made illustrious there by the
light of his  i see the blots i threw upon it faded away  i see
him foremost of just judges and honoured men bringing a boy of my
name with a forehead that i know and golden hair to this place
then fair to look upon with not a trace of this days disfigurement
and i hear him tell the child my story with a tender and a faltering
voice
too she was naturally so peculiar in appearance as not to show
disfigurement like any other woman  she needed both advantages for
the marks of gripping fingers were deep in her face and her hair was
torn and her dress hastily composed with unsteady hands was
clutched and dragged a hundred ways

in crossing the bridge she dropped the door key in the river
arriving at the cathedral some few minutes before her escort and
waiting there she thought what if the key were already taken in a
net what if it were identified what if the door were opened and the
remains discovered what if she were stopped at the gate sent to
prison and charged with murder  in the midst of these fluttering
thoughts the escort appeared took her in and took her away

is there any noise in the streets she asked him

the usual noises mr cruncher replied and looked surprised by the
question and by her aspect

i dont hear you said miss pross  what do you say

it was in vain for mr cruncher to repeat what he said miss pross
could not hear him  so ill nod my head thought mr cruncher
amazed at all events shell see that  and she did

is there any noise in the streets now asked miss pross again
presently

again mr cruncher nodded his head

i dont hear it

gone deaf in an hour said mr cruncher ruminating with his mind
much disturbed wots come to her

i feel said miss pross as if there had been a flash and a crash
and that crash was the last thing i should ever hear in this life

blest if she aint in a queer condition said mr cruncher more
and more disturbed  wot can she have been a takin to keep her
courage up  hark  theres the roll of them dreadful carts  you can
hear that miss

i can hear said miss pross seeing that he spoke to her
nothing  o my good man there was first a great crash and then a
great stillness and that stillness seems to be fixed and
unchangeable never to be broken any more as long as my life lasts

if she dont hear the roll of those dreadful carts now very nigh
their journeys end said mr cruncher glancing over his shoulder
its my opinion that indeed she never will hear anything else in
this world

and indeed she never did

the footsteps die out for ever


along the paris streets the deathcarts rumble hollow and harsh
six tumbrils carry the days wine to la guillotine  all the
devouring and insatiate monsters imagined since imagination could
record itself are fused in the one realisation guillotine  and yet
there is not in france with its rich variety of soil and climate
a blade a leaf a root a sprig a peppercorn which will grow to
maturity under conditions more certain than those that have produced
this horror  crush humanity out of shape once more under similar
hammers and it will twist itself into the same tortured forms
sow the same seed of rapacious license and oppression over again
and it will surely yield the same fruit according to its kind

six tumbrils roll along the streets  change these back again to what
they were thou powerful enchanter time and they shall be seen to
be the carriages of absolute monarchs the equipages of feudal nobles
the toilettes of flaring jezebels the churches that are not my
fathers house but dens of thieves the huts of millions of starving
peasants  no the great magician who majestically works out the
appointed order of the creator never reverses his transformations
if thou be changed into this shape by the will of god say the
seers to the enchanted in the wise arabian stories then remain so
but if thou wear this form through mere passing conjuration then resume
thy former aspect  changeless and hopeless the tumbrils roll along

as the sombre wheels of the six carts go round they seem to plough
up a long crooked furrow among the populace in the streets  ridges
of faces are thrown to this side and to that and the ploughs go
steadily onward  so used are the regular inhabitants of the houses
to the spectacle that in many windows there are no people
and in some the occupation of the hands is not so much as suspended
while the eyes survey the faces in the tumbrils  here and there
the inmate has visitors to see the sight then he points his finger
with something of the complacency of a curator or authorised exponent
to this cart and to this and seems to tell who sat here yesterday
and who there the day before

of the riders in the tumbrils some observe these things and all
things on their last roadside with an impassive stare others with
a lingering interest in the ways of life and men  some seated with
drooping heads are sunk in silent despair again there are some so
heedful of their looks that they cast upon the multitude such glances
as they have seen in theatres and in pictures  several close their
eyes and think or try to get their straying thoughts together
only one and he a miserable creature of a crazed aspect is so
shattered and made drunk by horror that he sings and tries to
dance  not one of the whole number appeals by look or gesture to
the pity of the people

there is a guard of sundry horsemen riding abreast of the tumbrils
and faces are often turned up to some of them and they are asked
some question  it would seem to be always the same question for
it is always followed by a press of people towards the third cart

they said of him about the city that night that it was the
peacefullest mans face ever beheld there  many added that he looked
sublime and prophetic

one of the most remarkable sufferers by the same axea womanhad
asked at the foot of the same scaffold not long before to be
allowed to write down the thoughts that were inspiring her  if he
had given any utterance to his and they were prophetic they would
have been these

i see barsad and cly defarge the vengeance the juryman the
judge long ranks of the new oppressors who have risen on the
destruction of the old perishing by this retributive instrument
before it shall cease out of its present use  i see a beautiful city
and a brilliant people rising from this abyss and in their struggles
to be truly free in their triumphs and defeats through long years
to come i see the evil of this time and of the previous time of
which this is the natural birth gradually making expiation for
itself and wearing out

i see the lives for which i lay down my life peaceful useful
prosperous and happy in that england which i shall see no more
i see her with a child upon her bosom who bears my name  i see her
father aged and bent but otherwise restored and faithful to all
men in his healing office and at peace  i see the good old man so
long their friend in ten years time enriching them with all he has
and passing tranquilly to his reward

i see that i hold a sanctuary in their hearts and in the hearts of
their descendants generations hence  i see her an old woman
weeping for me on the anniversary of this day  i see her and her
husband their course done lying side by side in their last earthly
bed and i know that each was not more honoured and held sacred in
the others soul than i was in the souls of both

i see that child who lay upon her bosom and who bore my name a man
winning his way up in that path of life which once was mine  i see
him winning it so well that my name is made illustrious there by the
light of his  i see the blots i threw upon it faded away  i see
him foremost of just judges and honoured men bringing a boy of my
name with a forehead that i know and golden hair to this place
then fair to look upon with not a trace of this days disfigurement
and i hear him tell the child my story with a tender and a faltering
voice
too she was naturally so peculiar in appearance as not to show
disfigurement like any other woman  she needed both advantages for
the marks of gripping fingers were deep in her face and her hair was
torn and her dress hastily composed with unsteady hands was
clutched and dragged a hundred ways

in crossing the bridge she dropped the door key in the river
arriving at the cathedral some few minutes before her escort and
waiting there she thought what if the key were already taken in a
net what if it were identified what if the door were opened and the
remains discovered what if she were stopped at the gate sent to
prison and charged with murder  in the midst of these fluttering
thoughts the escort appeared took her in and took her away

is there any noise in the streets she asked him

the usual noises mr cruncher replied and looked surprised by the
question and by her aspect

i dont hear you said miss pross  what do you say

it was in vain for mr cruncher to repeat what he said miss pross
could not hear him  so ill nod my head thought mr cruncher
amazed at all events shell see that  and she did

is there any noise in the streets now asked miss pross again
presently

again mr cruncher nodded his head

i dont hear it

gone deaf in an hour said mr cruncher ruminating with his mind
much disturbed wots come to her

i feel said miss pross as if there had been a flash and a crash
and that crash was the last thing i should ever hear in this life

blest if she aint in a queer condition said mr cruncher more
and more disturbed  wot can she have been a takin to keep her
courage up  hark  theres the roll of them dreadful carts  you can
hear that miss

i can hear said miss pross seeing that he spoke to her
nothing  o my good man there was first a great crash and then a
great stillness and that stillness seems to be fixed and
unchangeable never to be broken any more as long as my life lasts

if she dont hear the roll of those dreadful carts now very nigh
their journeys end said mr cruncher glancing over his shoulder
its my opinion that indeed she never will hear anything else in
this world

and indeed she never did

the footsteps die out for ever


along the paris streets the deathcarts rumble hollow and harsh
six tumbrils carry the days wine to la guillotine  all the
devouring and insatiate monsters imagined since imagination could
record itself are fused in the one realisation guillotine  and yet
there is not in france with its rich variety of soil and climate
a blade a leaf a root a sprig a peppercorn which will grow to
maturity under conditions more certain than those that have produced
this horror  crush humanity out of shape once more under similar
hammers and it will twist itself into the same tortured forms
sow the same seed of rapacious license and oppression over again
and it will surely yield the same fruit according to its kind

six tumbrils roll along the streets  change these back again to what
they were thou powerful enchanter time and they shall be seen to
be the carriages of absolute monarchs the equipages of feudal nobles
the toilettes of flaring jezebels the churches that are not my
fathers house but dens of thieves the huts of millions of starving
peasants  no the great magician who majestically works out the
appointed order of the creator never reverses his transformations
if thou be changed into this shape by the will of god say the
seers to the enchanted in the wise arabian stories then remain so
but if thou wear this form through mere passing conjuration then resume
thy former aspect  changeless and hopeless the tumbrils roll along

as the sombre wheels of the six carts go round they seem to plough
up a long crooked furrow among the populace in the streets  ridges
of faces are thrown to this side and to that and the ploughs go
steadily onward  so used are the regular inhabitants of the houses
to the spectacle that in many windows there are no people
and in some the occupation of the hands is not so much as suspended
while the eyes survey the faces in the tumbrils  here and there
the inmate has visitors to see the sight then he points his finger
with something of the complacency of a curator or authorised exponent
to this cart and to this and seems to tell who sat here yesterday
and who there the day before

of the riders in the tumbrils some observe these things and all
things on their last roadside with an impassive stare others with
a lingering interest in the ways of life and men  some seated with
drooping heads are sunk in silent despair again there are some so
heedful of their looks that they cast upon the multitude such glances
as they have seen in theatres and in pictures  several close their
eyes and think or try to get their straying thoughts together
only one and he a miserable creature of a crazed aspect is so
shattered and made drunk by horror that he sings and tries to
dance  not one of the whole number appeals by look or gesture to
the pity of the people

there is a guard of sundry horsemen riding abreast of the tumbrils
and faces are often turned up to some of them and they are asked
some question  it would seem to be always the same question for
it is always followed by a press of people towards the third cart
the horsemen abreast of that cart frequently point out one man in it
with their swords  the leading curiosity is to know which is he
he stands at the back of the tumbril with his head bent down
to converse with a mere girl who sits on the side of the cart
and holds his hand  he has no curiosity or care for the scene about him
and always speaks to the girl  here and there in the long street
of st honore cries are raised against him  if they move him at all
it is only to a quiet smile as he shakes his hair a little more
loosely about his face  he cannot easily touch his face his arms
being bound

on the steps of a church awaiting the comingup of the tumbrils
stands the spy and prisonsheep  he looks into the first of them
not there  he looks into the second  not there  he already asks
himself has he sacrificed me when his face clears as he looks
into the third

which is evremonde says a man behind him

that  at the back there

with his hand in the girls

yes

the man cries down evremonde  to the guillotine all aristocrats
down evremonde

hush hush the spy entreats him timidly

and why not citizen

he is going to pay the forfeit  it will be paid in five minutes more
let him be at peace

but the man continuing to exclaim down evremonde the face of
evremonde is for a moment turned towards him  evremonde then sees
the spy and looks attentively at him and goes his way

the clocks are on the stroke of three and the furrow ploughed among
the populace is turning round to come on into the place of execution
and end  the ridges thrown to this side and to that now crumble in
and close behind the last plough as it passes on for all are following
to the guillotine  in front of it seated in chairs as in a garden
of public diversion are a number of women busily knitting  on one
of the foremost chairs stands the vengeance looking about for her
friend

therese she cries in her shrill tones  who has seen her
therese defarge

she never missed before says a knittingwoman of the sisterhood

no nor will she miss now cries the vengeance petulantly
therese

louder the woman recommends

ay  louder vengeance much louder and still she will scarcely hear
thee  louder yet vengeance with a little oath or so added and yet
it will hardly bring her  send other women up and down to seek her
lingering somewhere and yet although the messengers have done dread
deeds it is questionable whether of their own wills they will go far
enough to find her

bad fortune cries the vengeance stamping her foot in the chair
and here are the tumbrils  and evremonde will be despatched in a
wink and she not here  see her knitting in my hand and her empty
chair ready for her  i cry with vexation and disappointment

as the vengeance descends from her elevation to do it the tumbrils
begin to discharge their loads  the ministers of sainte guillotine
are robed and ready  crasha head is held up and the knitting
women who scarcely lifted their eyes to look at it a moment ago when
it could think and speak count one

the second tumbril empties and moves on the third comes up  crash
and the knittingwomen never faltering or pausing in their work
count two

the supposed evremonde descends and the seamstress is lifted out
next after him  he has not relinquished her patient hand in getting
out but still holds it as he promised  he gently places her with
her back to the crashing engine that constantly whirrs up and falls
and she looks into his face and thanks him

but for you dear stranger i should not be so composed for i am
naturally a poor little thing faint of heart nor should i have been
able to raise my thoughts to him who was put to death that we might
have hope and comfort here today  i think you were sent to me by heaven

or you to me says sydney carton  keep your eyes upon me dear child
and mind no other object

i mind nothing while i hold your hand  i shall mind nothing when
i let it go if they are rapid

they will be rapid  fear not

the two stand in the fastthinning throng of victims but they speak
as if they were alone  eye to eye voice to voice hand to hand
heart to heart these two children of the universal mother else so
wide apart and differing have come together on the dark highway
to repair home together and to rest in her bosom

brave and generous friend will you let me ask you one last
question  i am very ignorant and it troubles mejust a little

tell me what it is

i have a cousin an only relative and an orphan like myself whom i
love very dearly  she is five years younger than i and she lives in
a farmers house in the south country  poverty parted us and she
knows nothing of my fatefor i cannot writeand if i could how
should i tell her  it is better as it is

yes yes  better as it is

what i have been thinking as we came along and what i am still
thinking now as i look into your kind strong face which gives me so
much support is thisif the republic really does good to the poor
and they come to be less hungry and in all ways to suffer less she
may live a long time  she may even live to be old

what then my gentle sister

do you think the uncomplaining eyes in which there is so much
endurance fill with tears and the lips part a little more and
tremble  that it will seem long to me while i wait for her in the
better land where i trust both you and i will be mercifully sheltered

it cannot be my child there is no time there and no trouble
there

you comfort me so much  i am so ignorant  am i to kiss you now
is the moment come

yes

she kisses his lips he kisses hers they solemnly bless each other
the spare hand does not tremble as he releases it nothing worse than
a sweet bright constancy is in the patient face  she goes next
before himis gone the knittingwomen count twentytwo

i am the resurrection and the life saith the lord
he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live
and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die

the murmuring of many voices the upturning of many faces
the pressing on of many footsteps in the outskirts of the crowd
so that it swells forward in a mass like one great heave of water
all flashes away  twentythree
