it was the best of times it was the worst of times
it was the age of wisdom it was the age of foolishness
it was the epoch of belief it was the epoch of incredulity
it was the season of light it was the season of darkness
it was the spring of hope it was the winter of despair
we had everything before us we had nothing before us
we were all going direct to heaven we were all going direct
the other wayin short the period was so far like the present
period that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its
being received for good or for evil in the superlative degree
of comparison only

there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face
on the throne of england there were a king with a large jaw and
a queen with a fair face on the throne of france  in both
countries it was clearer than crystal to the lords of the state
preserves of loaves and fishes that things in general were
settled for ever

it was the year of our lord one thousand seven hundred and
seventyfive  spiritual revelations were conceded to england at
that favoured period as at this  mrs southcott had recently
attained her fiveandtwentieth blessed birthday of whom a
prophetic private in the life guards had heralded the sublime
appearance by announcing that arrangements were made for the
swallowing up of london and westminster  even the cocklane
ghost had been laid only a round dozen of years after rapping
out its messages as the spirits of this very year last past
supernaturally deficient in originality rapped out theirs
mere messages in the earthly order of events had lately come to
the english crown and people from a congress of british subjects
in america  which strange to relate have proved more important
to the human race than any communications yet received through
any of the chickens of the cocklane brood

france less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than
her sister of the shield and trident rolled with exceeding
smoothness down hill making paper money and spending it
under the guidance of her christian pastors she entertained
herself besides with such humane achievements as sentencing
a youth to have his hands cut off his tongue torn out with
pincers and his body burned alive because he had not kneeled
down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession of monks
which passed within his view at a distance of some fifty or
sixty yards  it is likely enough that rooted in the woods of
france and norway there were growing trees when that sufferer
was put to death already marked by the woodman fate to come
down and be sawn into boards to make a certain movable framework
with a sack and a knife in it terrible in history  it is likely
enough that in the rough outhouses of some tillers of the heavy
lands adjacent to paris there were sheltered from the weather
that very day rude carts bespattered with rustic mire snuffed
about by pigs and roosted in by poultry which the farmer death
had already set apart to be his tumbrils of the revolution
but that woodman and that farmer though they work unceasingly
work silently and no one heard them as they went about with
muffled tread  the rather forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion
that they were awake was to be atheistical and traitorous

in england there was scarcely an amount of order and protection
to justify much national boasting  daring burglaries by armed
men and highway robberies took place in the capital itself
every night families were publicly cautioned not to go out of
town without removing their furniture to upholsterers warehouses
for security the highwayman in the dark was a city tradesman in
the light and being recognised and challenged by his fellow
tradesman whom he stopped in his character of the captain
gallantly shot him through the head and rode away the mail was
waylaid by seven robbers and the guard shot three dead and then
got shot dead himself by the other four in consequence of the
failure of his ammunition after which the mail was robbed in
peace that magnificent potentate the lord mayor of london was
made to stand and deliver on turnham green by one highwayman
who despoiled the illustrious creature in sight of all his
retinue prisoners in london gaols fought battles with their
turnkeys and the majesty of the law fired blunderbusses in among
them loaded with rounds of shot and ball thieves snipped off
diamond crosses from the necks of noble lords at court
drawingrooms musketeers went into st giless to search for
contraband goods and the mob fired on the musketeers and the
musketeers fired on the mob and nobody thought any of these
occurrences much out of the common way  in the midst of them
the hangman ever busy and ever worse than useless was in
constant requisition now stringing up long rows of miscellaneous
criminals now hanging a housebreaker on saturday who had been
taken on tuesday now burning people in the hand at newgate by
the dozen and now burning pamphlets at the door of westminster hall
today taking the life of an atrocious murderer and tomorrow of a
wretched pilferer who had robbed a farmers boy of sixpence

all these things and a thousand like them came to pass in
and close upon the dear old year one thousand seven hundred
and seventyfive  environed by them while the woodman and the
farmer worked unheeded those two of the large jaws and those
other two of the plain and the fair faces trod with stir enough
and carried their divine rights with a high hand  thus did the
year one thousand seven hundred and seventyfive conduct their
greatnesses and myriads of small creaturesthe creatures of this
chronicle among the restalong the roads that lay before them



ii

the mail


it was the dover road that lay on a friday night late in november
before the first of the persons with whom this history has business
the dover road lay as to him beyond the dover mail as it lumbered
up shooters hill  he walked up hill in the mire by the side of the
mail as the rest of the passengers did not because they had the
least relish for walking exercise under the circumstances but
because the hill and the harness and the mud and the mail were
all so heavy that the horses had three times already come to a stop
besides once drawing the coach across the road with the mutinous
intent of taking it back to blackheath  reins and whip and coachman
and guard however in combination had read that article of war
which forbade a purpose otherwise strongly in favour of the argument
that some brute animals are endued with reason and the team had
capitulated and returned to their duty

with drooping heads and tremulous tails they mashed their way
through the thick mud floundering and stumbling between whiles
as if they were falling to pieces at the larger joints  as often
as the driver rested them and brought them to a stand with a
wary woho sohothen the near leader violently shook his
head and everything upon itlike an unusually emphatic horse
denying that the coach could be got up the hill  whenever the
leader made this rattle the passenger started as a nervous
passenger might and was disturbed in mind

there was a steaming mist in all the hollows and it had roamed
in its forlornness up the hill like an evil spirit seeking rest
and finding none  a clammy and intensely cold mist it made its
slow way through the air in ripples that visibly followed and
overspread one another as the waves of an unwholesome sea might
do  it was dense enough to shut out everything from the light of
the coachlamps but these its own workings and a few yards of
road and the reek of the labouring horses steamed into it as if
they had made it all

two other passengers besides the one were plodding up the hill
by the side of the mail  all three were wrapped to the cheekbones
and over the ears and wore jackboots  not one of the three
could have said from anything he saw what either of the other
two was like and each was hidden under almost as many wrappers
from the eyes of the mind as from the eyes of the body of his
two companions  in those days travellers were very shy of being
confidential on a short notice for anybody on the road might be
a robber or in league with robbers  as to the latter when every
postinghouse and alehouse could produce somebody in the captains
pay ranging from the landlord to the lowest stable nondescript
it was the likeliest thing upon the cards  so the guard of the
dover mail thought to himself that friday night in november one
thousand seven hundred and seventyfive lumbering up shooters
hill as he stood on his own particular perch behind the mail
beating his feet and keeping an eye and a hand on the armchest
before him where a loaded blunderbuss lay at the top of six or
eight loaded horsepistols deposited on a substratum of cutlass

the dover mail was in its usual genial position that the guard
suspected the passengers the passengers suspected one another
and the guard they all suspected everybody else and the coachman
was sure of nothing but the horses as to which cattle he could
with a clear conscience have taken his oath on the two testaments
that they were not fit for the journey

woho said the coachman  so then  one more pull and youre
at the top and be damned to you for i have had trouble enough to
get you to itjoe

halloa the guard replied

what oclock do you make it joe

ten minutes good past eleven

my blood ejaculated the vexed coachman and not atop of
shooters yet  tst  yah  get on with you

the emphatic horse cut short by the whip in a most decided
negative made a decided scramble for it and the three other
horses followed suit  once more the dover mail struggled on
with the jackboots of its passengers squashing along by its
side  they had stopped when the coach stopped and they kept
close company with it  if any one of the three had had the
hardihood to propose to another to walk on a little ahead into
the mist and darkness he would have put himself in a fair way
of getting shot instantly as a highwayman

the last burst carried the mail to the summit of the hill
the horses stopped to breathe again and the guard got down to
skid the wheel for the descent and open the coachdoor to let
the passengers in

tst  joe cried the coachman in a warning voice looking down
from his box

what do you say tom

they both listened

i say a horse at a canter coming up joe

i say a horse at a gallop tom returned the guard leaving
his hold of the door and mounting nimbly to his place
gentlemen  in the kings name all of you

with this hurried adjuration he cocked his blunderbuss and
stood on the offensive

the passenger booked by this history was on the coachstep
getting in the two other passengers were close behind him and
about to follow  he remained on the step half in the coach and
half out of they remained in the road below him  they all
looked from the coachman to the guard and from the guard to the
coachman and listened  the coachman looked back and the guard
looked back and even the emphatic leader pricked up his ears and
looked back without contradicting

the stillness consequent on the cessation of the rumbling and
labouring of the coach added to the stillness of the night made
it very quiet indeed  the panting of the horses communicated a
tremulous motion to the coach as if it were in a state of
agitation  the hearts of the passengers beat loud enough perhaps
to be heard but at any rate the quiet pause was audibly
expressive of people out of breath and holding the breath and
having the pulses quickened by expectation

the sound of a horse at a gallop came fast and furiously up the hill

soho the guard sang out as loud as he could roar  yo there
stand  i shall fire

the pace was suddenly checked and with much splashing and floundering
a mans voice called from the mist is that the dover mail

never you mind what it is the guard retorted  what are you

is that the dover mail

why do you want to know

i want a passenger if it is

what passenger

mr jarvis lorry

our booked passenger showed in a moment that it was his name
the guard the coachman and the two other passengers eyed him
distrustfully

keep where you are the guard called to the voice in the mist
because if i should make a mistake it could never be set right
in your lifetime  gentleman of the name of lorry answer straight

what is the matter asked the passenger then with mildly
quavering speech  who wants me  is it jerry

i dont like jerrys voice if it is jerry growled the guard
to himself  hes hoarser than suits me is jerry

yes mr lorry

what is the matter

a despatch sent after you from over yonder  t and co

i know this messenger guard said mr lorry getting down into
the roadassisted from behind more swiftly than politely by the
other two passengers who immediately scrambled into the coach
shut the door and pulled up the window  he may come close
theres nothing wrong

i hope there aint but i cant make so nation sure of that
said the guard in gruff soliloquy  hallo you

well  and hallo you said jerry more hoarsely than before

come on at a footpace dye mind me  and if youve got holsters
to that saddle o yourn dont let me see your hand go nigh em
for im a devil at a quick mistake and when i make one it takes
the form of lead  so now lets look at you

the figures of a horse and rider came slowly through the eddying
mist and came to the side of the mail where the passenger stood
the rider stooped and casting up his eyes at the guard handed
the passenger a small folded paper  the riders horse was blown
and both horse and rider were covered with mud from the hoofs of
the horse to the hat of the man

guard said the passenger in a tone of quiet business confidence

the watchful guard with his right hand at the stock of his raised
blunderbuss his left at the barrel and his eye on the horseman
answered curtly sir

there is nothing to apprehend  i belong to tellsons bank
you must know tellsons bank in london  i am going to paris
on business  a crown to drink  i may read this

if so be as youre quick sir

he opened it in the light of the coachlamp on that side
and readfirst to himself and then aloud  wait at dover for
mamselle its not long you see guard  jerry say that my
answer was recalled to life

jerry started in his saddle  thats a blazing strange answer too
said he at his hoarsest

take that message back and they will know that i received this
as well as if i wrote  make the best of your way  good night

with those words the passenger opened the coachdoor and got in
not at all assisted by his fellowpassengers who had
expeditiously secreted their watches and purses in their boots
and were now making a general pretence of being asleep  with no
more definite purpose than to escape the hazard of originating
any other kind of action

the coach lumbered on again with heavier wreaths of mist closing
round it as it began the descent  the guard soon replaced his
blunderbuss in his armchest and having looked to the rest of its
contents and having looked to the supplementary pistols that he wore
in his belt looked to a smaller chest beneath his seat in which
there were a few smiths tools a couple of torches and a tinderbox
for he was furnished with that completeness that if the coachlamps
had been blown and stormed out which did occasionally happen he had
only to shut himself up inside keep the flint and steel sparks well
off the straw and get a light with tolerable safety and ease if he
were lucky in five minutes

tom softly over the coach roof

hallo joe

did you hear the message

i did joe

what did you make of it tom

nothing at all joe

thats a coincidence too the guard mused for i made the
same of it myself

jerry left alone in the mist and darkness dismounted meanwhile
not only to ease his spent horse but to wipe the mud from his
face and shake the wet out of his hatbrim which might be
capable of holding about half a gallon  after standing with the
bridle over his heavilysplashed arm until the wheels of the
mail were no longer within hearing and the night was quite still
again he turned to walk down the hill

after that there gallop from temple bar old lady i wont trust
your forelegs till i get you on the level said this hoarse
messenger glancing at his mare  recalled to life  thats a
blazing strange message  much of that wouldnt do for you jerry
i say jerry  youd be in a blazing bad way if recalling to life
was to come into fashion jerry

the night shadows


a wonderful fact to reflect upon that every human creature is
constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other
a solemn consideration when i enter a great city by night that
every one of those darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret
that every room in every one of them encloses its own secret that
every beating heart in the hundreds of thousands of breasts there
is in some of its imaginings a secret to the heart nearest it
something of the awfulness even of death itself is referable to
this  no more can i turn the leaves of this dear book that i loved
and vainly hope in time to read it all  no more can i look into the
depths of this unfathomable water wherein as momentary lights
glanced into it i have had glimpses of buried treasure and other
things submerged  it was appointed that the book should shut with
a spring for ever and for ever when i had read but a page  it was
appointed that the water should be locked in an eternal frost when
the light was playing on its surface and i stood in ignorance on the
shore  my friend is dead my neighbour is dead my love the darling
of my soul is dead it is the inexorable consolidation and
perpetuation of the secret that was always in that individuality
and which i shall carry in mine to my lifes end  in any of the
burialplaces of this city through which i pass is there a sleeper
more inscrutable than its busy inhabitants are in their innermost
personality to me or than i am to them

as to this his natural and not to be alienated inheritance
the messenger on horseback had exactly the same possessions as
the king the first minister of state or the richest merchant
in london  so with the three passengers shut up in the narrow
compass of one lumbering old mail coach they were mysteries to
one another as complete as if each had been in his own coach and
six or his own coach and sixty with the breadth of a county
between him and the next

the messenger rode back at an easy trot stopping pretty often at
alehouses by the way to drink but evincing a tendency to keep his
own counsel and to keep his hat cocked over his eyes  he had eyes
that assorted very well with that decoration being of a surface
black with no depth in the colour or form and much too near
togetheras if they were afraid of being found out in something
singly if they kept too far apart  they had a sinister expression
under an old cockedhat like a threecornered spittoon and over a
great muffler for the chin and throat which descended nearly to the
wearers knees  when he stopped for drink he moved this muffler
with his left hand only while he poured his liquor in with his
right as soon as that was done he muffled again

no jerry no said the messenger harping on one theme as he rode
it wouldnt do for you jerry  jerry you honest tradesman it
wouldnt suit your line of business  recalled  bust me if i
dont think hed been a drinking

his message perplexed his mind to that degree that he was fain
several times to take off his hat to scratch his head  except on
the crown which was raggedly bald he had stiff black hair
standing jaggedly all over it and growing down hill almost to his
broad blunt nose  it was so like smiths work so much more like
the top of a strongly spiked wall than a head of hair that the best
of players at leapfrog might have declined him as the most
dangerous man in the world to go over

while he trotted back with the message he was to deliver to the night
watchman in his box at the door of tellsons bank by temple bar who
was to deliver it to greater authorities within the shadows of the
night took such shapes to him as arose out of the message and took
such shapes to the mare as arose out of her private topics of
uneasiness  they seemed to be numerous for she shied at every
shadow on the road

what time the mailcoach lumbered jolted rattled and bumped upon
its tedious way with its three fellowinscrutables inside  to whom
likewise the shadows of the night revealed themselves in the forms
their dozing eyes and wandering thoughts suggested

tellsons bank had a run upon it in the mail  as the bank passenger
with an arm drawn through the leathern strap which did what lay in
it to keep him from pounding against the next passenger and driving
him into his corner whenever the coach got a special joltnodded in
his place with halfshut eyes the little coachwindows and the
coachlamp dimly gleaming through them and the bulky bundle of
opposite passenger became the bank and did a great stroke of business
the rattle of the harness was the chink of money and more drafts
were honoured in five minutes than even tellsons with all its
foreign and home connection ever paid in thrice the time  then the
strongrooms underground at tellsons with such of their valuable
stores and secrets as were known to the passenger and it was not a
little that he knew about them opened before him and he went in
among them with the great keys and the feeblyburning candle and
found them safe and strong and sound and still just as he had
last seen them

but though the bank was almost always with him and though the coach
in a confused way like the presence of pain under an opiate was
always with him there was another current of impression that never
ceased to run all through the night  he was on his way to dig some
one out of a grave

now which of the multitude of faces that showed themselves before
him was the true face of the buried person the shadows of the night
did not indicate but they were all the faces of a man of fiveand
forty by years and they differed principally in the passions they
expressed and in the ghastliness of their worn and wasted state
pride contempt defiance stubbornness submission lamentation
succeeded one another so did varieties of sunken cheek cadaverous
colour emaciated hands and figures  but the face was in the main
one face and every head was prematurely white  a hundred times the
dozing passenger inquired of this spectre

buried how long

the answer was always the same  almost eighteen years

you had abandoned all hope of being dug out

long ago

you know that you are recalled to life

they tell me so

i hope you care to live

i cant say

shall i show her to you  will you come and see her

the answers to this question were various and contradictory
sometimes the broken reply was wait  it would kill me if i saw
her too soon  sometimes it was given in a tender rain of tears
and then it was take me to her  sometimes it was staring and
bewildered and then it was i dont know her  i dont understand

after such imaginary discourse the passenger in his fancy would dig
and dig dignow with a spade now with a great key now with his
handsto dig this wretched creature out  got out at last with
earth hanging about his face and hair he would suddenly fan away to
dust  the passenger would then start to himself and lower the
window to get the reality of mist and rain on his cheek

yet even when his eyes were opened on the mist and rain on the
moving patch of light from the lamps and the hedge at the roadside
retreating by jerks the night shadows outside the coach would fall
into the train of the night shadows within  the real bankinghouse
by temple bar the real business of the past day the real strong
rooms the real express sent after him and the real message returned
would all be there  out of the midst of them the ghostly face would
rise and he would accost it again

buried how long

almost eighteen years

i hope you care to live

i cant say

digdigdiguntil an impatient movement from one of the two
passengers would admonish him to pull up the window draw his arm
securely through the leathern strap and speculate upon the two
slumbering forms until his mind lost its hold of them and they
again slid away into the bank and the grave

buried how long

almost eighteen years

you had abandoned all hope of being dug out

long ago

the words were still in his hearing as just spokendistinctly in his
hearing as ever spoken words had been in his lifewhen the weary
passenger started to the consciousness of daylight and found that
the shadows of the night were gone

he lowered the window and looked out at the rising sun  there was a
ridge of ploughed land with a plough upon it where it had been left
last night when the horses were unyoked beyond a quiet coppicewood
in which many leaves of burning red and golden yellow still remained
upon the trees  though the earth was cold and wet the sky was
clear and the sun rose bright placid and beautiful

eighteen years said the passenger looking at the sun
gracious creator of day  to be buried alive for eighteen years

the preparation


when the mail got successfully to dover in the course of the
forenoon the head drawer at the royal george hotel opened the
coachdoor as his custom was  he did it with some flourish of
ceremony for a mail journey from london in winter was an achievement
to congratulate an adventurous traveller upon
